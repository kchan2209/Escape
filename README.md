<p> The objective of our game is to lead a character out of an abandoned building after being mysteriously left there. The genre of the game is RPG game. In order to interact with the game, you must use the keyboard to use the "WASD" keys to move the character. The challenge is to collect keys as you go to different rooms and not touch the monster. If you collide with the monster, health would be taken away. In order to win, you need to colect all keys. In order to lose, you will have no health annymore because you might've been caught by the monster.</p>
